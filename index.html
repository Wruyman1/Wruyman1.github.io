<h1>Hello all! Myname is Bill Ruymann. Welcome to my page!</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm a Computer Programming student at Wake Tech with a strong passion for technology and creative problem-solving. I’m also a dedicated sports fan who proudly supports my hometown teams—the Miami Heat, Florida Panthers, Miami Marlins, and Miami Dolphins.
When I’m not coding or cheering on my teams, I enjoy playing board games—Betrayal at House on the Hill is a personal favorite. I also love traveling and hope to explore more of the world once I begin my professional career in tech.
Thanks for visiting my site—I’m excited to share my journey with you!</p>
